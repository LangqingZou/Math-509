# Exploring Asian students' resilience
## Background
Resilience can be defined as “good outcomes in spite of serious threats to adaptation or development”. The purpose of our study was to conduct linear regression, decision treer, and random forest analyses based on data from PISA 2018 in an Asian context to explore the relationship between multiple independent variables (self, family and social-environmental characteristics) and student resilience. In 2018, nearly 80 countries participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), but here we only focus on seven Asian countries: China, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Korea and Japan. PISA assesses 15-year-old students’ proficiency in reading, mathematics, and science and collects data on a large number of contextual factors through questionnaires administered to students, teachers, and school leaders. Our model analysis revealed that students' perceptions of school belonging, subjective well-being, gender, economic, social and cultural status, family wealth, internet access at home, and parental moral support were statistically significant predictors of resilience.
